Rise of agile Manifesto(2001) that introduced principles emphasizing iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability.
Emergence of DevOps to bridge the gap between development and operations, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements - Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design phase - creating detailed designs, system architecture and user interface.
implementation - writing code with respect to the design specifications.
Testing - conducting various tests to Check whether key functionality is met along with quality standards.
Deployment - Software is released for mass consumption.
Maintenance - Involves making updates to existing software, ongoing support, bug fixes and enhancements.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall model is a linear sequential development process, where each phase must be completed before the next begins. It's often likened to a waterfall, as progress flows in one direction.
**FEATURES**
Higher risk involved because issues may be discovered late in development.
Slower because entire product is developed before release.
Low customer involvement which mainly in the beginning and at the end.
Phases (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment) follow a strict order.
Rigid as changes are difficult to make once the process begins.

Agile methodology involves a flexible approach that emphasizes iterative development, customer collaboration, and continuous improvement. It's designed to adapt to changing requirements and deliver value early and often.
**FEATURES**
Risks are identified and mitigated throughout the process
Faster working product is delivered in small increments (sprints)
High continuous feedback and collaboration
Phases (planning, design, development, testing) run concurrently
Highly adaptable as changes can be made at any stage

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions also maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.

A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing software tests plans. Liase with stakeholders to understand and clarify the software requirement. Create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow. Ensure software meets the requirement standards before deployment.

A Project Manager oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects, Tracking and communicating information progress with reference to the project milestone, mobilize and lead the software development team, deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs offer a comprehensive suite of features that significanty increase productivity, efficiency and overall quality of the software development process. Some of its advantages include: code editing and completion, debugging, build automation, version control integration, project management and plugin ecosystem.

**IMPORTANCE OF IDEs**
Enhance productivity by providing tools like auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging that speeds up development.
Efficient debugging and testing with built-in debuggers help developers identify and fix errors quickly.
Code Consistency and Standardization as it supports code formatting and linting tools to enforce best coding practices.
Seamless integration with other tools such as compilers, version control systems, and package managers for efficient workflow.
Multi-language support and Project Management helps developers manage multiple languages and manage complex projects within a single interface.
 
Version Control is a tool that tracks changes to source code and allows developers to collaborate, manage previous versions of their code including reverting code to previous states if necessary. Its essential in: collaboration, code history, Branching and merging and back up & recovery.

**Importance of Version Control Systems**
Collaboration and teamwork simplifies multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work.
Tracking changes and history allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.
Through branching and merging developers can create separate branches for features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.
Backup and recovery has enabled Code to be stored in a central or distributed repository, preventing data loss and enabling easy recovery

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Managing changing requirements - Frequent changes from stakeholders can lead to scope creep, increasing complexity and delays. The SOLUTION entails using Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban) to accommodate evolving requirements as well as keeping a Product Backlog and prioritize features using MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have) analysis.

Ensuring code quality and maintainability - Writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code while meeting deadlines is difficult. The SOLUTION entails Use code reviews, pair programming, proper documentation and automated linters to maintain consistency in addition to following coding standards.

Security and data privacy concerns - Even though protecting software from cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and data breaches is critical, implementing robust security measures while maintaining performance is a challenge. The SOLUTION entails implementing secure coding practices and using encryption, authentication, and role-based access control (RBAC) for data protection.

Integration with existing systems - Many projects require integration with legacy systems or third-party APIs, which may have compatibility issues. The SOLUTION entails conducting compatibility testing before full scale deployment as well as follow Microservices Architecture for better modularity and easier integration.

Testing and Bug Fixing - Identifying and fixing bugs across different environments and devices can be time-consuming.Inadequate testing may lead to undetected issues that affect software performance and user experience. The SOLUTION entails using automated testing tools for efficiency along with Implementing Test-Driven Development (TDD) to catch bugs early.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - Involves testing individual components of software
Integration testing - Involves testing interactions between different components or sub-systems
System testing - Involves testing the entire system as a whole.
Acceptance testing - Involves testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Software Testing is an important phase in the software development life cycle that ensures quality and reliability in the final product. Aids in quality assurance, risk mitigation, boosts confidence, user satisfaction and compliance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting effective prompts to elicit desired responses from artificial intelligence models.
Its importances include:
Task completion - Clear and concise prompts can help AI models understand the task at hand and generate outputs that fulfill specific requirements.
Accurate and relevant responses - Well-crafted prompts can significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses, ensuring that the model provides information that is useful and informative.
Efficiency - Effective prompt engineering can save time and effort by reducing the need for multiple iterations or clarifications.
Creativity and innovation - By experimenting with different prompt formats and styles, users can encourage AI models to generate creative and innovative responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: What is climate change?
Specific prompt: Define climate change, its impact on the environment and atmosphere, how humans have contributed to it & it's effects and possible remedies.

The clearer the prompt, the more relevant, efficient, and accurate the AI's response will be. The same principle applies in reverse.
